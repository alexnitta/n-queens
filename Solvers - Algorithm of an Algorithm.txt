Solvers - Algorithm of an Algorithm

findNRooksSolution

- inputs: n (size of chessboard and also number of pieces)
- output: single solution, array of arrays with n rooks places so none of them can attach each other
- tools: Board Viewer
  - board.js: a class for boards, where we can modify board contents and test if there are conflicts
  - libraries: jQuery, backbone
- form a naive approach to the problem
  - need to find a single solution
  - create a permutation
    - permutations with n pieces on a board of nxn size
    
  - test the permutation with methods on board.js, including row and column conflicts
